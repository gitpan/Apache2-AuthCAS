Apache2/AuthCAS version 0.4
===========================

The Apache2::AuthCAS module allows a user to protect their non-Java content on
an Apache server with the Yale CAS authentication server.

INSTALLATION

    To install this module type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    You should run one of the schema*.sql scripts or an equivalent script using
    a database of your choice to initially create the session table.  The
    chosen database name and table names should match the parameters configured
    in either the module itself or the Apache directory configuration
    specified.  This can be done for PostgreSQL like so:

        psql -h <dbhost> -U <dbuser> -f schemaPg.sql <dbname>

    Of course <dbhost>/<dbuser>/<dbname> should be replaced above by the
    settings that match your environment.

    If you are upgrading from a previous version, a new field has been added
    to the session table!  Please be aware of this and compare the schema
    files to your installation!
